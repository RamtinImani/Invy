# 🏭 Invy - Inventory Tracking App

**Invy** is a responsive inventory tracking application built using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project was created as a practice to strengthen my skills in **JavaScript OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** and **Tailwind CSS**.

With Invy, users can easily manage product inventories by creating categories, adding and organizing products, and performing actions such as search, filter, edit, and delete.

## 📚 Project Overview

This app is a simple yet powerful tool to understand how to build a fully functional front-end application using:

- **HTML** for structuring content
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript (OOP)** for dynamic functionality and application logic

Each feature in the app was built with the aim of putting Object-Oriented Programming principles into real-world practice, such as using classes for managing product and category data, encapsulation, and modular code organization.

⚠️Note: For the app to work correctly (especially JavaScript modules), you must run it through a local development server. Opening `index.html` directly from the file system (`file://`) will cause CORS errors in modern browsers.
